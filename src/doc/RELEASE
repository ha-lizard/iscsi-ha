Initial Public Release - June 2013
Version 1.2.11

- Added auto plugging of iscsi SR to deal with XenServer failing to properly plug SR on boot

Version 1.2.12 - August 6, 2013
- Build/added DRBD RPMs compatible with XenServer 6.2. RPMs are now provided for XCP 1.6, XenServer 6.1 and XenServer 6.2

Version 1.2.14 - September 1, 2013
- Resolved errant ping notice in log
- Added exit timeout to email alerting
- Moved environment out of config file to more transparently deal with upgrades
- Added logic to replug PBD to resolve issues with Xenserver not properly plugging iscsi SR after a hard reboot or shutdown.

Version 1.2.15
- Some email alerts had truncated content. Resolved
- Updated installer to save configuration settings when upgrading

Version 1.3.1 - October 2013
- Resolved race condition on poor performing dom0s when attemping to plug PBD
- Added DRBD kernel module to distribution package for update XS62E004 kernel version 2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.8.0.839.170780xen
- Updated email alert logic to prevent hanging when network or DNS is down
- New python driven MTA replaces mailx from previous version. Mailx is no longer required for alerts
- Suppress email alerts to avoid sending useless alerts while iscsi-ha initializes services that
  were not really failed - were just stopped since service may not have been running
- Updated installer not to check/prompt for mailx dependancy
- Validated support for kernel version 2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.8.0.839.170780xen

Version 1.3.7 - December 2013
- Clear potential dangling logger processes that could occur on unclean exit or bad configuration parameters
- Updated init script now manages logger processes
- replug_pbd updated - will exit if the master is not reachable by a calling slave
- Support for XenServer 6.2 SP1 kernel version - added DRBD compatible kernel RPM to package

Version 1.4.2 - April 2014
- Resove minor display bug (warning) when manually starting service for the first time.
  Init script updated to first check whether directory exists in RAM before attempting to write to it.
- Added manual operating mode which allows an administrator to temporarily disable automatic management of
  storage location (eg. exposed on master or slave). Manual mode provides the ability to move storage
  as needed to allow for rolling pool updates or server maintenance/reboots without any VM downtime.
- Expanded CLI 'iscsi-cfg' with additional command line arguments to deal with manual mode
  New arguments include manual-mode-enable, manual-mode-disable, become-primary, become-secondary
- Updated CLI to detect status when operating in manual mode
- Updated installation script to better deal with noSAN automated installer requirements
- Updated init to prevent starting service while in manual mode

Version 1.4.3 - June 2014
- Resolved bug in replug_pbd which was not parsing SR UUIDs correctly when more than one iSCSI SR exists. 
- Resolved minor bug in CLI when viewing status. Incorrect IP list was being displayed while in
  manual mode if using an interface other than xenbr1 for replication. Status will now dynamically
  display the correct IPs based on the interface name set in the configuration.

Version 1.4.4 - July 2014
- Added DRBD kernel module to distribution package for version 2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.8.0.853.170791xen

Version 1.4.5 - September 2014
- Resolved minor bug in CLI which displayed IP data incorrectly when using an interface other than xenbr1

Version 1.5.4 - April 2015
- Support for DRBD 8.4.3
- Updated installer for noSAN installer support
- Improved email handler removes dependancy for sendmail
- Centralized email configuration settings dynamically pull email and SMTP settings from ha-lizard/xapi DB
  When using iscsi-ha with ha-lizard, email settings can now be set in only one place - via ha-cfg CLI
- Tab completion added for ha-cfg CLI tool
- Improved layout of status monitor
- Added DRBD live status to iscsi-cfg status monitor

Version 1.5.5 - August 2015
- Added compiled DRBD modules for XenSever kernel version 2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.8.0.861.170802xen

Version 1.5.6 - September 2015
- Significantly improved switchover time on failure or manual-mode role reversal
- Cleaned up IP address(es) displayed while in manual-mode
- Bug fix: replug_pbd was limited to deal with only 2 iSCSI SRs. Update allows for any number of configured iSCSI SRs

Version 1.5.7 - May 2016
- Bug fix: under certain conditions, iscsi target started before DRBD primary role was asserted. TGT will now only start
  after DRBD role has successfully transitioned to primary.
- Added DRBD kernel module and RPMS for latest 6.2 kernel 2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.8.0.865.170810xen
- iSCSI-HA now allows for a seamless transition of the pool master into maintenance mode allowing the slave (new master)
  to take over management of the storage.

Version 2.0 - July 2016

Version 2.0.2_beta
- New build compatible with XenServer 7 (Centos 7 style dom0) - !! not backward compatible with XenServer 6.x !!
- Improved manual mode validations now provide stateful updates of expected manually assigned roles.
  State changes and errors are now handled in real time
- init updated for systemd compatibility
- DRBD RPMs no longer packaged with releases

Version 2.1.0 - November 2016
- Bug fix: display error when transitioning host to secondary role while in manual mode. Path to status function was being overwritten at runtime
- Bug Fix: iscsi-cfg status was displaying erroneous PID. Resolved
- Bug Fix: iscsi-ha and watchdog init scripts were storing wrong PID in pid file. Resolved
- Bug Fix: Status was displaying wrong running state of iscsi-ha daemon
- Added daemon-reload on success of drop-in file creation

Version 2.1.1 - November 2016
- Added frequent ARP updates from host that is exposing storage on replication network. Resolves issues with replication networks
  using bonds that fail to initialize after certain simulated network crashes.
- Added DRBD split brain recovery tool
- Added -v option to CLI for checking version

Version 2.1.2 - December 2016
- Merged with version 1.5.7 for backward compatibility
- Bug Fix - MAC address parsing selected IPv6 address in some cases. Resolved
- Bug Fix - Watchdog was not sourcing environment at runtime
- cli tool status now displays version
- updated target daemon controller for backward compatibility
- updated init for support in both xenserver 6 and 7 environemnts

Version 2.1.3 - December 2016
- Bug Fix - installer was adding an invalid character to tgt drop-in config which created delay when stopping daemon - resolved.
- Bug Fix - ARP updates were in some cases excluding some interfaces in a bond - resolved.
- Bug Fix - Build 29877, updated daemon controller to be backward compatible when full path to init scripts declared

Version 2.1.4 - Jan 2017
- Bug Fix - #1142 - cli status when in manual mode displayed errored run state of iscsi target daemon due to unpopulated manual mode role
  in manual mode lock file. Fix now bootstraps ../state/manual with an initial role based on the host's master/slave status in the pool.
- Failed attempts to start DRBD daemon will now be retried in a loop until the daemon starts successfully.
- Reverted to old method (pre version 2) of updating ARP on replication interface. Due to known ARP update issues on network bridges with
  a bond - it is advised that replication bond mode be set to active/passive
- Added XenServer 6.5 DRBD RPMs to package

Version 2.1.5 - August 2017
- Bug Fix - in XenServer 7.x deployments, systemd could start DRBD before the network is ready causing DRBD to start with no resources loaded.
- Bug fix: updated init to wait for xapi to fully initialize before starting iscsi-ha

Version 2.2.0 - October 2018
- Various bug fixes that could cause erroneous warnings.
- Added stateful configuration manager which preserves all settings when running in a 2-node hyperconverged pool.
  Settings are stored in a central DB that will survive dom0 upgrades without loss of configuration data. Two
  new CLI commands have been introduced for managing lvm, tgt, drbd and iscsi-ha configuration data; <backup|restore>
  Stateful storage of configuration data makes it possible to more easliy manage major version upgrades to dom0 ensuring
  that all configuration data remains with the pool.
- Removed requirement to manually patch default iptables rules to allow replication. Firewall is now statelessly managed
  at runtime of iscsi-ha service. IMPORTANT - FW logic drives from the configured floating IP address (DRBD_VIRTUAL_IP) and
  assumes a /24 CIDR. Example. A replication IP of 10.10.10.3 will result in a FW rule allowing 10.10.10.0/24
- Updated init script waits for xapi and fw to fully initialize before allowing service startup.
- Updated init script to initialize proper state after a dom0 upgrade
- Tested for compatibility with XenServer 7.x and XCP-ng 7.5
- Added alerts functionality that can be viewed from within XenCenter or from ha-cfg CLI tool
- Display bug resolved. When watching status with iscsi-cfg while DRBD is resyncing, %
  character caused a printf error

Version 2.2.1 - October 2019
- Added new logic to detect and correct ARP failing to update peer on replication interface which could occur when a bonded link
  is used inside a linux bridge.
- Upated fw_init for backward compatibility with pre version 7 hosts using SystemV to address
  https://halizard.com/forum/suggestion-box/337-etc-iscsi-ha-scripts-fw-init-line-65-systemctl-command-not-found
- Added SSL support to email handler

Version 2.2.2 - October 2019
- removed dependancy on networkctl since xcp/xenserver v8 no longer include it in default dom0

Version 2.2.3 - October 2019
- Bug Fix #1926: function replication_link_check was not parsing the host interface list correctly when dealing with a bond with more than 2 interfaces.
- restore_replication_link updated to deal with bonds with more than 2 interfaces

Version 2.2.4 - November 2019
- Bug Fix - function manage_db_manual_mode updated to better deal with missing param when installed on top of a very old version of HA-Lizard

Version 2.2.5 - Feb 2021
- Bug Fix - manual mode tracking could produce a "unary operator expected" error if state file is missing or empty
- Added DRBD disk state tracking and alerting
- Added DRBD split-brain alerting via XenCenter/XCP-ng Center. Alert script can be found in
  /etc/iscsi-ha/scripts/drbd-split-brain-alert. Newly installed systems utilizing the noSAN auto installer
  script will have this functionality enabled by default. Existing systems can enable DRBD split-brain notification
  by adding "handlers { split-brain "/etc/iscsi-ha/scripts/drbd-split-brain-alert"; }" to each host's DRBD resource.

Version 2.2.6 - August 2024
- Bug Fix - IFS was not restored before calling replication_link_check - causing interface looping to break
- Bug Fix - Resolved race condition with DRBD and multipathd which was introduced in XCP 8.2.1 release

Version 2.2.7 - Nov 2024
- Code preparation for moving project to github. No logic changes. Only some comments added/removed
